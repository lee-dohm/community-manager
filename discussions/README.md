# Discussions

I've spent about 30 years in message boards, discussion forums, social networks, and chat rooms. I've seen and used all different kinds of electronic communications. And one thing that I've heard fairly often recently is that "discussions" or "forums" are easy because all you have to do is string together comments. This myth is perpetuated by social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and even Stack Overflow because that's really all they are: some type of content with a string of comments afterward. But to truly foster the kind of communication that can happen in a message board, there are a number of additional features that one has to have.
